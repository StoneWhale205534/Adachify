Youtube Adachify

Enhance your browsing experience with Adachiifier. Is your browser experience boring? Are you having trouble finding engaging click-baity videos? Fear no more. This extension adds the famous Adachi to every thumbnail.


This extension is unofficial and not affiliated with Adachi, Atlus or YouTube.


I didn't make this, I only made the Adachi-tastic images and changed some details. I took this from @surely_somebody on Twitterwho made the Game Theory extension (also in the file under "matpatify"), which was based off of the MrBeast extension. 

Use the tutorial picture if you need help. Should be similar in other browsers such as Edge
